## Usage instructions

- Open two seperate terminals.

- Start the client.py on one terminal and server.py on the other terminal.

- On the client application, type a message that will be sent over to the other terminal.

- Verify that the message has been received on the other terminal.

- Write a response message from the server terminal that will be sent back to the client.

- Verify that the message has been received on the other terminal.

- The program will automatically close, so you can just exit out of both of the terminals.
